# Analysis

After organizing and cleaning the data we were able to gain interesting insight to the possible effectiveness of different drug regimens. After calculating some general summary statistics we saw that Capomulin and Ramicane had lower average tumor sizes than the other regimens. Additionaly, they had lower variation and standard deviation, which could perhaps signal more consistent effects. We furher explored our initial insight through a series of plos and graphs. We isolated the ending tumor size and our box plot clearly illustarated that these two regimens were more effective than the others in decreasing tumor size. We also found that there is a direct correlation between mouse weight and tumor size with an r value of .84. Something that would be interesting to further investigate would be if the mice on the Capomulin and Ramicane regimens had lower weights overall than the other regimens. Additionally, it would be interesting to know why there were more mice completing these two regimens. Were mice in the other studies dying before finishing or was it just a larger starting population?
